        Hygienic Golgappe with Authentic Street Taste
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-center">
        Kuch Teekha Hojaye was born from one simple problem faced by every food
        lover in Karachi — unhygienic street food.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-center">
        Like many others, we loved golgappe and pani puri, but we were concerned
        about unsafe water, poor hygiene, and open roadside preparation. That’s
        when we decided to create a safer alternative.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed text-center">
        We recreated the original Karachi pani puri taste in a controlled cloud
        kitchen, using RO purified mineral water, fresh ingredients, and
        professional food handling standards. Today, our mineral water Golgappe
        allow families to enjoy street food without fear.
